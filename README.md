How to compile the program: run "make exec" or "make redir" in the terminal while inside the p2 folder
Run the compiled autograder as follows: ./autograder solutions <p1>, <p2>, ...

Assumptions:
Each submission executable accepts a single integer parameter and returns an integer value
The results vary machine to machine, in our case, we used a CSE Lab Machine that supports Linux. (Important for get_batch_size function specifically)
